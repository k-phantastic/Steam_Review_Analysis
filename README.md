# Steam Review Analysis

## Overview

In this project we will examine a dataset containing more than 100 million Steam reviews and attempt to create two machine learning models: one to predict the helpfulness of user reviews, and the other to create distinct clusters of Steam reviewers. Data will be processed and stored on a cluster on San Diego Computer Center (SDSC) with primary usage of Spark through PySpark.
